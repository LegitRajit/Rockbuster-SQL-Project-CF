# Rockbuster SQL Project Overview

Inside of this repository is my full analysis on a sample movie rental company, Rockbuster Stealth using SQL. 
Through this project, I learned some of the basics of SQL such as making queries, navigating around a database by using JOINS, and using subqueries

I've included... 

1) A pdf of my power point presentation, containing all my insights and reccomendations for Rockbuster
2) An Excel Workbook, containing all the pulled tables from doing each of the SQL queries
3) Separate files of some of the major SQL queries
4) A Link to all my [Visualizations using Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rajit.sikka/viz/FilmAnalysis_17007626662980/Bottom10Films)
